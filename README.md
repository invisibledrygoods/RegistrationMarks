Registration Marks
==================

Quick tool to anchor things to screen edges.

How It Works
------------

Attach it to a child of the camera, then attach children to it. It scales to fill the screen vertically
and anchors to the left, right or center. Mostly useful for 3d GUIs.

To Do
-----

I needed this really quickly for a client so it only works in side scroller oriented cameras right now.
I'll modify it to work in coordinates local to the camera when it comes up or on request.
